# Sentiment-Analysis

This program uses Naive Bayes to predict movie review sentiments based in the [imdb dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)


If the jupyter notebook (main.ipynb) is not rendering, visit this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jadessechan/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/main.ipynb) 

## Getting started
1. clone or download this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jadessechan/Sentiment-Analysis.git
```
2. open main.ipynb
3. run all the code cells to see the final prediction of a movie review

## Demo
Cell 7 (step 4) has code commented-out by default that was used for training purposes

In real world scenarios, class imbalances are very common but for the purposes of this project I chose a balanced data set:
